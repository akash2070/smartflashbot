# Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This repository contains a Flash Loan Arbitrage Bot designed to operate on the BNB Chain (Binance Smart Chain). The bot automatically identifies and executes profitable arbitrage opportunities across multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXes) by utilizing flash loans to maximize capital efficiency.

The system consists of:

1. A core arbitrage engine that identifies price discrepancies
2. Flash loan integration for capital-efficient trading
3. Multiple DEX integrations (PancakeSwap V2/V3, ApeSwap, BiSwap)
4. Smart contract components for on-chain execution
5. A real-time monitoring dashboard

The bot implements advanced MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) strategies and includes safety mechanisms to protect against network congestion and competitive bots.

## System Architecture

The architecture follows a modular design with clear separation of concerns:

## Key Components

### 1. Arbitrage Engine

The arbitrage engine is responsible for identifying profitable trading opportunities across different DEXes.

**Key files**:
- `src/arbitrage/opportunities.js` - Identifies arbitrage opportunities
- `src/arbitrage/calculator.js` - Calculates profitability

**Design decisions**:
- Uses parallel price queries across DEXes to minimize latency
- Implements fallback mechanisms for RPC rate limits
- Calculates optimal flash loan size based on liquidity

### 2. DEX Integrations

The system integrates with multiple DEXes on BNB Chain to maximize opportunity discovery.

**Key files**:
- `src/dex/pancakeswapV2.js` - PancakeSwap V2 integration
- `src/dex/pancakeswapV3.js` - PancakeSwap V3 integration (with multi-fee tier support)
- `src/dex/apeswap.js` - ApeSwap integration
- `src/dex/biswap.js` - BiSwap integration
- `src/dex/constants.js` - DEX contract addresses and configurations

**Design decisions**:
- Each DEX is implemented as a separate module with a consistent interface
- Supports both router-based (V2) and pool-based (V3) DEX architectures
- Implements retry logic with exponential backoff for reliability

### 3. Flash Loan Execution

The system uses flash loans to execute arbitrage without requiring significant capital.

**Key files**:
- `src/flashloan/executor.js` - Handles flash loan execution
- `contract_for_remix_v5.txt` - Smart contract for on-chain execution

**Design decisions**:
- Uses PancakeSwap V3 Flash for capital-efficient arbitrage
- Implements OpenZeppelin's upgradeable contract pattern for future upgrades
- Includes safety mechanisms to prevent failed arbitrage transactions

### 4. MEV Protection

The system includes MEV protection strategies to minimize frontrunning and optimize execution.

**Key files**:
- `src/mev/protection.js` - MEV protection mechanisms
- `src/mev/strategies.js` - Advanced MEV strategies like backrunning

**Design decisions**:
- Monitors mempool for potential MEV activity
- Implements adaptive gas price strategies
- Supports transaction bundling to minimize MEV exposure

### 5. Blockchain Providers

The system uses multiple RPC providers with fallback mechanisms to ensure reliable blockchain connectivity.

**Key files**:
- `src/providers/blockchain.js` - Creates providers and wallets
- `src/providers/multiProvider.js` - Implements fallback provider logic
- `src/providers/pairSpecificProvider.js` - Optimizes RPC usage by token pair

**Design decisions**:
- Uses a combination of premium and public RPC endpoints
- Implements pair-specific providers to distribute load
- Supports WebSocket providers for real-time mempool monitoring

### 6. Dashboard

A real-time dashboard provides monitoring of bot performance and market conditions.

**Key files**:
- `dashboard-server.js` - Main dashboard server
- `src/dashboard/server.js` - Dashboard implementation
- `src/dashboard/priceService.js` - Real-time price data service
- `src/dashboard/tracker.js` - Performance tracking

**Design decisions**:
- Implemented as a standalone Express server that can run independently
- Uses Socket.IO for real-time updates
- Provides visualizations of arbitrage opportunities and execution history

### 7. Smart Contracts

The system includes Solidity smart contracts that execute the actual arbitrage.

**Key files**:
- `contract_for_remix_v5.txt` - Main flash loan arbitrage contract
- `deploy_*.js/sh` files - Various deployment scripts

**Design decisions**:
- Uses OpenZeppelin's upgradeable contract pattern
- Implements reentrancy protection and pausable pattern for security
- Supports multiple DEX interactions in a single flash loan transaction

## Data Flow

1. **Opportunity Identification**:
   - The bot continuously monitors prices across multiple DEXes
   - When a price discrepancy is detected, the arbitrage calculator determines profitability

2. **Execution Decision**:
   - If an opportunity is profitable after fees and gas costs:
     - In contract mode: The bot calls the deployed smart contract
     - In direct mode: The bot executes trades directly via DEX routers

3. **Flash Loan Process**:
   - The smart contract borrows tokens via flash loan
   - Executes arbitrage trades across DEXes
   - Repays the loan with a profit margin
   - Returns remaining profit to the contract owner

4. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Execution results are tracked and displayed on the dashboard
   - Safety mechanisms monitor for adverse conditions

## External Dependencies

- MEV protection mechanisms
- Slippage controls to prevent excessive price impact

## Configuration

The system is highly configurable through environment variables:

- `PRIVATE_KEY`: Wallet private key for transaction signing
- `BNB_TESTNET_RPC_URL` / `BNB_RPC_URL_KEY`: RPC endpoints
- `SESSION_SECRET`: Dashboard security
- `USE_REAL_BLOCKCHAIN`: Toggle between simulation and real blockchain
- `PRODUCTION_MODE`: Enable production-specific safeguards
- `ENABLE_DASHBOARD`: Toggle dashboard functionality
