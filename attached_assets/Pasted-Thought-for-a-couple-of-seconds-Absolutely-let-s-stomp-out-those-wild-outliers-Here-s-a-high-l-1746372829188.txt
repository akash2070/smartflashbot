Thought for a couple of seconds


Absolutely—let’s stomp out those wild outliers. Here’s a high-level plan and some sample code you can adapt to your stack:

---

## 1. Sanity checks & thresholds

Before you surface a price, run it through simple guards:

* **Max/min bounds** (e.g. ignore any price ≤ 0 or ≥ 10× the typical market rate)
* **Percentage‐change cap** (e.g. if price deviates by more than, say, 5% from an average of other DEXs, drop it)
* **Parse-error fallback** (if your JSON parse produces an absurdly large integer, catch it and fall back to `null` or the last good value)

```js
// Example in JavaScript / Node.js
const MAX_PRICE = 2;    // e.g. for BUSD/USDT we know it should hover around ~1
const MIN_PRICE = 0.5;
const MAX_DIFF_PERCENT = 5;  

function sanitizePrice(pair, dexPrices) {
  const raw = dexPrices[pair];
  let price = Number(raw);
  if (isNaN(price)) {
    throw new Error(`Invalid number for ${pair}: ${raw}`);
  }
  // simple bounds check
  if (price < MIN_PRICE || price > MAX_PRICE) {
    console.warn(`Dropping ${pair} price ${price} outside bounds`);
    return null;
  }
  // compare against average of others
  const others = Object.values(dexPrices).filter(p => p !== raw).map(Number);
  const avg = others.reduce((a,b)=>a+b, 0)/others.length;
  if (Math.abs(price - avg)/avg * 100 > MAX_DIFF_PERCENT) {
    console.warn(`Dropping ${pair} price ${price} deviates >${MAX_DIFF_PERCENT}% from avg ${avg}`);
    return null;
  }
  return price;
}
```

---

## 2. Logging & alerting

Whenever a price is dropped, log the raw response (timestamped) so you can trace back which DEX or API call mis-behaved.

```js
if (!sanitized) {
  logger.error({
    pair,
    rawPrice: raw,
    dex: currentDex,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  });
}
```

---

## 3. Fallback strategy

* If all DEXs for a pair are filtered out, fall back to a trusted oracle or simply display “N/A” rather than garbage data.
* Optionally cache the last valid price and display “stale” with a warning flag.

---

### Next steps

1. Which language or framework is your pipeline in?
2. Do you already collect prices into a single object or row per pair?
3. Can you share a snippet of your fetch/parsing logic?

With that info I can give you copy-and-paste–ready fixes. Let me know!
