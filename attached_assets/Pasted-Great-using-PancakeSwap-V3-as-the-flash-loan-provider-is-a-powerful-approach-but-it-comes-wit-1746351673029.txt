Great â€” using **PancakeSwap V3 as the flash loan provider** is a powerful approach, but it comes with specific **technical requirements** and **contract-level integrations** since PancakeSwap V3 doesn't provide flash loans out-of-the-box like Aave or dYdX. Here's **everything you need to execute flash loans on PancakeSwap V3**, with full research-based details:

---

## âœ… PancakeSwap V3 Flash Loan Integration Breakdown

### ðŸ”· 1. **Can PancakeSwap V3 Provide Flash Loans?**

**Yes, indirectly.** PancakeSwap V3 pools can support flash loans **if you implement the logic using a custom smart contract** that:

* Interacts with the V3 **Pool contract** using `flash()` function
* Implements the **callback interface** `IPancakeV3FlashCallback`

---

### ðŸ”· 2. **Required Smart Contract Interfaces**

You need to interact with the following:

#### ðŸ›  Contracts & Addresses

| Item                           | PancakeSwap V3 Mainnet BSC                   |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Factory**                    | `0x1097053Fd2ea711dad45caCcc45EfF7548fCB362` |
| **Router** (v3)                | `0x46a15B0b27311cedF172AB29E4f4766fbE7F4364` |
| **Quoter** (v3)                | `0x78D78E420Da98ad378D7799bE8f4AF69033EB077` |
| **NonfungiblePositionManager** | `0x22F345507e0477C021f0d49F5B52F4F8D2C80D6A` |

Youâ€™ll need to **instantiate pool contracts dynamically** based on token pairs.

---

### ðŸ”· 3. **Flash Loan Flow (Contract Level)**

Your bot should interact with a custom Solidity contract that:

1. Calls `flash()` on a selected **V3 pool contract**
2. Implements `IPancakeV3FlashCallback`, which gets triggered **after the pool sends tokens**
3. Arbitrage logic happens inside this callback
4. Repays the flash loan **plus fee** by end of callback, or the transaction reverts

---

### ðŸ”· 4. **Solidity Interfaces Needed**

* [`IPancakeV3Pool`](https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-v3-core/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/IPancakeV3Pool.sol)
* [`IPancakeV3FlashCallback`](https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-v3-core/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/callback/IPancakeV3FlashCallback.sol)

---

### ðŸ”· 5. **Flash Loan Contract Structure (Overview)**

```solidity
contract PancakeFlashLoanBot is IPancakeV3FlashCallback {
    function startFlashLoan(address pool, uint amount0, uint amount1) external {
        IPancakeV3Pool(pool).flash(address(this), amount0, amount1, abi.encode(...));
    }

    function pancakeV3FlashCallback(uint fee0, uint fee1, bytes calldata data) external override {
        // Arbitrage logic here
        // Use the borrowed funds to trade across DEXs (e.g., Uniswap/Sushi/Pancake)
        // Then repay the pool: amount + fee
    }
}
```

---

### ðŸ”· 6. **Flash Loan Fee on PancakeSwap V3**

The fee depends on the **pool's fee tier**:

* Common tiers: **0.01%, 0.05%, 0.25%, 1%**
* You must read the poolâ€™s fee tier dynamically

---

## ðŸ“˜ ABI & Interaction in JavaScript/Node (Bot Side)

In your Replit Node.js bot, youâ€™ll need to:

1. Load the **pool ABI**:

   * Use `@pancakeswap/v3-core` ABI for `IPancakeV3Pool`
   * OR copy from [GitHub source](https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-v3-core/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/IPancakeV3Pool.sol)

2. Detect available V3 pools:

   * Using factory contract `getPool(tokenA, tokenB, fee)`

3. Call `flash()` with encoded data

   * Use `ethers.Contract(poolAddress, abi, signer)` to interact

---

## ðŸ§  Libraries You Need (Confirm Installed)

Ensure these are in your `package.json`:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "ethers": "^5.7.2",
  "@pancakeswap/v3-sdk": "^3.0.0",
  "@pancakeswap/smart-router": "^3.0.0",
  "@uniswap/sdk-core": "^3.0.0",
  "viem": "^1.4.0",
  "graphql-request": "^5.1.0",
  "dotenv": "^16.0.0"
}
```

Would you like me to provide:

1. The **ABI files** for `Router`, `Factory`, and `Pool`
2. A **Solidity FlashLoan template**
3. An updated **JavaScript bot module** to trigger `flash()` via ethers.js?

Let me know which of these you want next.
