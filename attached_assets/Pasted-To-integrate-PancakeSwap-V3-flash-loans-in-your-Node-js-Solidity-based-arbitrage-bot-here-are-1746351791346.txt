To integrate **PancakeSwap V3 flash loans** in your Node.js + Solidity-based arbitrage bot, here are all the **libraries and dependencies** you need to install, grouped by purpose:

---

## âœ… 1. **Core Blockchain Libraries**

These are required for interacting with BSC and smart contracts:

```bash
npm install ethers@5.7.2
npm install dotenv
```

---

## âœ… 2. **PancakeSwap & DEX SDKs**

Required to interact with PancakeSwap V3 smart contracts and calculate routes:

```bash
npm install @pancakeswap/v3-sdk @pancakeswap/smart-router
npm install @uniswap/sdk-core
```

* `@pancakeswap/v3-sdk`: Core math and token utilities (fork of Uniswap V3 SDK)
* `@pancakeswap/smart-router`: For finding the most efficient trade paths
* `@uniswap/sdk-core`: Used internally by both SDKs for token/price formatting

---

## âœ… 3. **GraphQL & HTTP Requests**

For querying The Graph or price APIs:

```bash
npm install axios graphql-request
```

---

## âœ… 4. **Optional Utility Libraries (Recommended)**

```bash
npm install moment
npm install winston
```

* `moment`: For timestamp and duration formatting
* `winston`: For log handling (alerts, events, errors)

---

## âœ… 5. **Real-time Dashboard (Optional for Monitoring)**

Only needed if you're building a web interface:

```bash
npm install express socket.io chart.js
```

---

## âœ… 6. **Solidity Smart Contract Dependencies (Hardhat or Foundry)**

If you're using **Hardhat** for smart contract development:

```bash
npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers
npm install @pancakeswap/v3-core @pancakeswap/v3-periphery
```

These packages include:

* `IPancakeV3Pool`
* `IPancakeV3FlashCallback`
* Router, Quoter, Factory ABIs
