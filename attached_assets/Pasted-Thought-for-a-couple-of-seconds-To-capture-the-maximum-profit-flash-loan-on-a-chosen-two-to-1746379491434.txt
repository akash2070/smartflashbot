Thought for a couple of seconds


To capture the **maximum‐profit flash loan** on a chosen two-token pair, you need to automate two critical steps:

1. **Find the optimal loan size** (the amount that yields the highest net profit after fees, slippage & gas).
2. **Execute the flash‐loan trade** atomically once that size is known.

Here’s a high-level recipe you can implement in your bot:

---

## 1. Detect & Quantify the Opportunity

1. **Fetch live reserves** $(R_A,R_B)$ on both DEXes.
2. **Compute on-chain prices** $P_1 = R_{B1}/R_{A1}$ and $P_2 = R_{B2}/R_{A2}$.
3. **Calculate spread**

   $$
     \text{spread} = \bigl|P_1 - P_2\bigr| \big/ \min(P_1,P_2).
   $$

   If spread ≤ your minimum threshold (e.g. 0.1%), abort.

## 2. Scan Candidate Loan Sizes

You need to model, for each candidate loan $L$ in a grid (e.g. 1%, 2%, … 5% of the smaller pool):

1. **Simulate swap out** on DEX A:

   $$
     \Delta B = \frac{R_B}{R_A + L}\;L \times (1 - f_A)
   $$
2. **Simulate swap back** on DEX B:

   $$
     \Delta A = \frac{R'_A}{R'_B + \Delta B}\;\Delta B \times (1 - f_B)
   $$
3. **Compute gross profit** in token A:
   $\Delta A - L$.
4. **Subtract flash‐loan fee** (e.g. 0.09% of $L$).
5. **Subtract gas** (estimate 200 k–300 k gas at current gas price → USD).
6. **Record net profit** for loan = $L$.

Repeat for each $L$, storing $(L,\;\text{netProfit}(L))$.

---

## 3. Pick the Maximum

* **Find** $L^* = \arg\max_L \text{netProfit}(L)$.
* **Ensure** netProfit$(L^*)$ ≥ your profit floor (e.g. \$50).
* If it’s negative or below floor, skip execution.

## 4. Build & Send the Flash-Loan Transaction

Using PancakeSwap V3’s flash-loan API:

```js
// Pseudocode (Ethers.js style)
const loanAmount = Lstar;         // best loan size in token A
const params = encodeSwapPath(...); // path A→B→A, with fee tiers

await pancakeV3Router.flash(
  TOKEN_A,                     // token to borrow
  loanAmount,                  // amount
  params,                      // callback data
  {
    gasLimit: estimatedGas,    // buffer for both swaps
    maxFeePerGas: highGwei,    // backloaded to prioritize
  }
);
```

Inside your callback (`uniswapV3FlashCallback`):

1. **Swap** borrowed A → B on DEX A (via its router).
2. **Swap back** B → A on DEX B.
3. **Repay** the borrowed amount + flash fee.
4. Any leftover A is **your profit** (auto-sent to your address).

---

## 5. (Optional) Use MEV Bundling

To avoid frontrunners:

* **Bundle** your flash-loan + both swaps + repayment into one atomic transaction.
* **Send** via a private relay (Flashbots-style on BNB Chain) or via a sentry/ArcherSwap route.

This ensures no one can sandwich or out-race your bot once you’ve found $L^*$.

---

### Summary

1. **Continuously** monitor spreads.
2. **Simulate** netProfit over a grid of loan sizes.
3. **Select** the size giving max netProfit (above your threshold).
4. **Submit** a single atomic flash-loan transaction with that optimal amount.
5. **(Optionally)** route via a private mempool to guarantee execution.

By automating those steps, your bot will always borrow the **exact amount** that maximizes profit for each arbitrage opportunity.
